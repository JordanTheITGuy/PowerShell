<#
.SYNOPSIS
    This script is used to gather data from ConfigMgr using a SQL Query and then saves that information to a CSV file. The data can then be picked up by another agent
    and or compressed and e-mailed. This may later be used in various ConfigMgr HealthChecks.

.DESCRIPTION
	Run several functions to gather data. Remove reports that are old and log the creation of the data. 	

.PARAMETER Param
    There are currently no required pararmeters to run this report. If you wish to modify this script you can do so by changing the SQL query content in the invoke-reportcommand.

.EXAMPLE
	The script is static and is simply called by a scheduled task.
